# CardioMetaHybridOptimizer
CardioMetaHybridOptimizer (CMHO) is a multiphase hybrid algorithm for feature selection in cardiovascular disease prediction. It combines LO, MPA, MRFO, mutation, and ILS to boost accuracy, reduce error, and enhance convergence on medical datasets.

<p><b> Features </b></p>
<li> Hybrid optimization using LO, MPA, MRFO</li>

<li>Dynamic mutation and local search (ILS)</li>

<li>Supports classifiers: SVM, RF, XGBoost, CNN-LSTM</li>

<li>Benchmark-tested on 5 cardiovascular datasets</li>

<li>Improves accuracy, F1-score, and reduces error rates</li>



<p><b> Applications </b></p>
<li> CMHO is designed to enhance the accuracy of CVD diagnosis by selecting the most relevant clinical and lifestyle features. It supports early detection and risk classification to improve patient outcomes.</li>

<li>It can be applied to other health domains like diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. CMHO efficiently reduces high-dimensional data to essential variables, improving model performance.</li>

<li>The algorithm can be integrated into wearable or IoT-based health systems for real-time decision support. Its lightweight feature subsets make deployment faster and more efficient.</li>

<li>CMHO helps researchers identify key biomarkers and stratify patient groups in clinical datasets. This supports precision medicine and data-driven healthcare innovation.</li>

<li>By filtering out irrelevant or redundant features, CMHO enhances model training efficiency and generalization. It reduces overfitting and boosts performance across various AI tasks.</li>
