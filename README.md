Initialization
A population of candidate feature subsets is randomly generated as binary vectors. Each solution is evaluated using a fitness function based on classification performance (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).

Global Exploration (Lemur Optimizer - LO)
The population undergoes wide exploration using random leaping behavior. This phase ensures diverse coverage of the feature space to avoid premature convergence.

Intermediate Refinement (Marine Predators Algorithm - MPA)
High-potential solutions are adaptively refined based on cooperative hunting behavior.The search space is narrowed around the most promising feature subsets.

Focused Exploitation (Manta Ray Foraging Optimization - MRFO)
Solutions are fine-tuned using somersault foraging strategies.This phase performs intensive local exploitation to find optimal feature subsets.

Diversity Enhancement (Dynamic Mutation + Iterative Local Search - ILS)
If no improvement is observed, poorly performing solutions undergo fitness-ranked mutations.ILS explores neighborhoods around top solutions to recover from stagnation and enhance convergence.

Convergence Monitoring
Fitness improvements are continuously tracked.If the best solution stagnates or the maximum iterations are reached, the algorithm terminates.

Final Output
The best feature subset, along with classification metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score), is reported.
